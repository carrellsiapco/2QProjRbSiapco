          </div>
          <section class="info">
            <p> Face to face learning was the mode of learning we previously used when the pandemic didn't exist yet. Students and teachers would go to school from Monday to Friday, and do their work there. Unlike distance learning, people in this mode of learning are actually closer to each other.
              <br>
              <br>
              Students have fun seeing their friends and classmates physically. After the week of major exams, some go out to malls with their friends. Students usually have many hands-on activities because they can move around more in a larger area. Besides academics, most have club activities after school hours, and this is when they have even more fun.   </p>

          <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
          <p>The main advantage to this is the fact that people are physically closer to each other. This means that there are no factors like weak internet connection or the absence of a gadget to be considered because they are irrelevant in this setting. The instructions from teacher to student will be clearer, and when a student wants to ask something, they don't need to send an email and wait for an indefinite amount of time. They can just walk through a few floors at most and their teacher would be there. This is also helps students have (physical) breathing room, because they are going to many classrooms in a day, unlike in distance learning where you do everything in front of a monitor.
            <br>
            <br>
            The main disadvantage however is the fact that it is generally more unsafe than distance learning. We are considering this mode during a pandemic, and when even one student or staff member contracts the virus, countless people will be harmed. This disadvantage could be easily fixed however, if you follow protocols like wearing a mask, disinfecting and washing your hands frequently, and practicing social distancing.

            <h3>Feasibility</h3>
            <p>Is it feasible? For most establishments, yes. A relatively small amount of money is needed to provide things like extra masks, disinfecting stations, etc.</p>
