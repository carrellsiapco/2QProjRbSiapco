          <p class="intro">Unless you've been living under a rock, you know by now about the pandemic that has brought a mountain of problems in every part of the world. This is especially evident in the Philippines, where until now, we still haven't recovered completely from the effects of this pandemic. One of the most affected parts of the community was the education sector, as students and teachers alike were forced to study and work inside their homes. 
            <br>
            <br>
            We have tried many different set-ups, and schools have made many adjustments to the system to address students' concerns, yet despite all of this, many individuals have yet to adjust properly, This website aims to discuss the main academic set-ups amidst the pandemic in the Philippines under the view of a student, and discuss details like feasibility and descriptions as well.</p>
