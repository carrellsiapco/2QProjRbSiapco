                Blended learning, sometimes called hybrid learning, is the mix of face to face teaching and the usage of gadgets and the internet. Basically, it is the combination of the other two modes of learning on this website. Some directions from teachers will be given during face to face times, while others may be distributed in online learning platforms. The same goes for activities and schoolwork: some can be done in school, while others can be done at home, on the computer.

              <br>
              Because of the pandemic, everyone was forced to study and work at home. With blended learning however, you can leave your home and study and work, and at the same time, you can still work and study at home.  </p>

          <h3>Advantages and Disadvantages</h3>
          <p>Since this is a mix of two learning modes, it covers almost every mistake from both. Exposure to people outside of your home is limited because you stay outside for only a shorter time compared to the time we spent outside during face-to-face classes. Factors like internet connection and the presence of a gadget are less relevant now, because you can do your work in school too. Besides this, you are also able to communicate with your peers and teachers, and when you have a question you can ask them immediately.

            <br>
           The only problem about this is the planning. There are many things to be considered while planning for such a learning set-up, like the students' and teachers' schedules. The staff must be able to communicate with the community to be able to make a schedule that would be best for everyone. These people also need to adjust from working indoors to working outside, so this takes time as well. The school staff also need to properly design protocols, and make sure the community is safe in the limited time they are outside.  </p>

            <h3>Feasibility</h3>
            <p>Is it feasible? It will be only when things like the ones mentioned above are properly planned. But as of now, no.</p>
